*A concept [as described by](http://www.lostgarden.com/2014/12/loot-drop-tables.html) Daniel Cook.*

Loot Drop Tables are a content driven approach to defining what kind of loot you want to drop and with what chance.

**Quick Overview**
- Define your tables in JSON or XML
- Weighted drop table allows you to set drop chance of each loot item
- `DropTableSampler` picks random loot out of your table based on weights
